Hello!

Today, I am going to show you all something very useful.

We are going to learn how to use Django Registration to simplify our login Process.

We will be using a custom user model with all available fields at the signup process.

Later on, I will show you a cool way of adding a profile to a user!

We will also be doing this on Linux, as well as using a live e-mail for showing the
activation workflow.

I will also show you all a few tricks I have picked up along the way to keep my code
cleaner for version control.


To-Do:

1] Create our Django project. 

2] Make our project git friendly.

3] Set up Postgresql.

4] Set up email config.

4] Make an app named accounts, write views for all methods and get a complete authentication system working in the end.



Pre Requisites:
    Django - Our main App Framework.
    Django-Registration - The package we will use for e-mail activation.
    Pillow - Helpful python imaging Library.
    psycopg2-binary - Postgresql connector.

    # packages I like to use in development.
