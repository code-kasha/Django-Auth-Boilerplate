Hello!

Today, I am going to show you guys something very useful.

We are going to learn how to use Django Registration to simplify our login Process.

We will be using a custom user model with all available fields at the signup process.

Later on, I will show you a cool way of adding a profile to a user!

We will also be doing this on Linux, as well as using a live e-mail for showing the
activation workflow.

I will also show you guys a few tricks I have picked up along the way to keep my code
cleaner for version control.


To-Do:

1] Create our Django project. 

2] Set up Postgresql.

3] Make our project git friendly.

4] Make an app named accounts, write views for all methods and get a complete authentication system working in the end with email verification. 



Pre Requisites:
    Django - Our main App Framework.
    Django-Registration - The package we will use for e-mail activation.
    Pillow - Helpful python imaging Library.
    psycopg2-binary - Postgresql connector.

    # packages I like to use in development.
    - flake8 - Linter.
    - black  - Code Formatter.
    - pylance - Vscode extension.
    - Django  - Vscode extension.
